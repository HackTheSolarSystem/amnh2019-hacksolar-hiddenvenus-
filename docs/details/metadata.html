The main source of information on this format is The FBIDR-SIS, which is stored in <code>papers+documents/MGN-FBIDR-SIS-SDPS-101-RevE.pdf</code>. We got all of our information from here. Though there are a few locations where the FBIDR-SIS was wrong, had to find that out the hard way.</p><h1 id="getting-the-f-bidr-files">Getting the F-BIDR files</h1><p>The F-BIDR files can be downloaded from <a href="http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/mgn/mgn-v-rdrs-5-bidr-full-res-v1/">here</a>.</p><p>This is a mirror hosting all the different F-BIDR files. Here&rsquo;s a small part of the directory tree from the mirror:</p><ul><li><code>MG_4001</code><ul><li><code>F0376_3</code><ul><li><code>FILE_01</code></li><li><code>FILE_02</code></li><li><code>FILE_03</code></li><li><code>FILE_04</code></li><li><code>...</code></li></ul></li><li><code>F0377_3</code></li><li><code>F0378_3</code></li><li><code>F0379_3</code></li><li><code>F0380_3</code></li></ul></li></ul><p>The Magellan data was originally stored and distributed on CD-ROMs. Folders like <code>MG_4001</code> are the contents of one of those CD-ROMs; we will call these <em>Magellan Volumes</em>. Folders like <code>F0376_3</code> are the F-BIDRs; they consist of 20 files (at least) all of the form <code>FILE_01</code>, <code>FILE_02</code>. These 20 files should be present in every F-BIDR, have the same name in each F-BIDR, and each file stores the same sort of information for each F-BIDR. For example, files 13 and 15 are image data in a special format.</p><p>Each magellan volume has an <code>AAREADME.TXT</code> file and some have <code>ERRATA.TXT</code>. The <code>AAREADME.TXT</code> is the same for all of the volumes; it just describes the different files contained in each F-BIDR and has some other information. While it is worth a read, much of the same information can be found in the FBIDR-SIS.</p><h1 id="contents-of-each-f-bidr">Contents of Each F-BIDR</h1><p>Each F-BIDR contains data which corresponds to one pass of the Magellan satellite around Venus. So the naming scheme of the F-BIDR is</p><pre><code>"F" orbit-number "_" version-number</code></pre><p>For instance, the orbit number and version number for <code>F0376_3</code> are &ldquo;376&rdquo; and &ldquo;3&rdquo; respectively.</p><p>The following applies to Files 12 to 19 of each F-BIDR (fbidr-sis page 3&ndash;11). These are binary files&mdash;you won&rsquo;t be able to read them as raw text&mdash;similar to a photo or a music file. This is in contrast to text data formats like XML or JSON which did not exist at the time. Each of these files is comprised of <em>logical records</em>. Some files are just one logical record, they tend to be smaller. Other files&mdash;especially thsoe that contain image data&mdash;have more logical records.</p><h1 id="overview-of-the-image-data">Overview of the Image Data</h1><p>Important info in for the image data in an F-BIDR. <code>FILE_13</code> and <code>FILE_15</code> are the image data in an F-BIDR. As an example file_15, let&rsquo;s use <code>MG_4001/F0376_3/FILE_15</code>.</p><p>This file, like the rest, is comprised of logical records. Many of them. Our example file has <em>5187</em> logical records.</p><p>Each of these logical records contains a single image. Metadata in the logical record states how tall and wide the image is. We can interpret these images as greyscale images, but be <em>careful</em>. The intensities are not indicative of the visual intensities of the landscape. The landscape is not being illuminated by optical light of any kind in these photos; the SAR on Magellan recorded reflected radiation that Magellan itself shot at the land. See the <a href="/amnh2019-hacksolar-hiddenvenus-/docs/intro.html">intro</a> for more details.</p><p>There is location metadata recording in each logical record as well to state what location on Venus the contained image corresponds to. The location metadata is relative to a <em>reference point</em>.</p><p>Each of these logical records has the following metadata:</p><ul><li>Image Line Count: How tall the contained image is.</li><li>Image Line Length: How wide the contained image is.</li><li>Reference point latitude: The latitude of the reference point of the contained image.</li><li>Reference point longitude: The longitude of the reference point of the contained image.</li></ul><p>Each pixel of the image is 75m × 75m large. That means one intensity value represents the reflected radiation for a 75m × 75m section of Venus&rsquo; surface. The center of the first pixel of the first line is the reference point of the contained image.</p></body>
