An elevation map is just like a regular map, except for every latitude and longitude, we will know the height of the land. Mountains will be high, valleys will be low, plains will generally be in the middle.</p><h1 id="why-are-we-doing-it">Why are we doing it?</h1><ul><li>Because it&rsquo;s cool.</li><li>Because it&rsquo;s fun.</li><li>Because we were asked to.</li><li>It is an interesting trip through time as we work with programs and  data from the early 90s.</li><li>The results are beautiful, and they will be even more beautiful when  paired with AMNH&rsquo;s OpenSpace program.</li></ul><h1 id="status-report">Status Report</h1><p>The magellan satellite orbited around Venus many times, taking pictures of the land that it passsed over using radiation, rather than visible light. These pictures were stored in an old format created by NASA that is not in use anymore. We can read the image data from these old files and write them as <code>PNG</code> files. It is possible to write them in other image formats, too. We can read in the binary data from a single orbit from the Magellan Mission and view it as greyscale images.</p><p>Since each of these files is the result of scanning Venus&rsquo; surface during one orbit, the image data contained corresponds to a very long and narrow strip; thus they are commonly called <em>noodles</em>. These images are very wide and very tall with a lot of black space because each noodle tends to &ldquo;sweep&rdquo; eastward on the planet toward the end. Below is a comparison between a strip that&rsquo;s been reduced to 1% of its original size, alongside a small section at the top of the strip that is at full scale. The original size of the noddle is 3456x115528 (3456 pixels wide x 115528 pixels tall). The scaled-down version has dimensions 35x1155; you can see a small red rectangle on the scaled-down version on the left which indicates the region that the larger picture corresponds to. The rectangle is hard to see; that is how small of a piece the right side is when taken from the left side.</p><div id="orbit-side-by-side" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;"><img id="small" src="/docs/readme-images/1-per-scale-strip-indicator.png" alt="Scaled down noodle image"/> <img id="big" src="/docs/readme-images/strip-long-cropped.png" alt="Scaled down noodle image"/></div><p>We&rsquo;re currently researching leads on what to do next. There are existing tools for generating DEMs, but would not be directly compatible with the Magellan data. There&rsquo;s also existing work on the Magellan data we could improve on. Finally, there are tools to create DEMs used for later planetary missions; perhaps we could make use of those by making them compatible with magellan data.</p><p>Things Coming Soon!</p><ul><li>Project Introduction<ul><li>What is a DEM? (done)</li></ul></li><li>Details<ul><li>Map coordinate system: 0&ndash;360 long which goes eastward, 90 to 90 lat with goes north to south.</li><li>Composition of a noodle. This is important to the noodle creation process, and to explaining any graphs of the image records.<ul><li>reference pixel: what is it, where is it in each snapshot?</li><li>Consists of individual logical records each holding small snapshot</li><li>Explain how the noodle image (not stitching) is generated.</li><li>Explain the naming of the BIDRs: orbit no and version, so you can reference them as such later on.</li></ul></li><li>How we piece together pieces of an image.</li><li>Magellan Data particulars<ul><li>Cycles, what was gained from each cycle.</li><li>Binary format of the data.</li><li>The format of the files, at least. And their role. I could  at least point them to a good page in the FBIDR SIS.</li></ul></li><li>Explanation of image metadata, important pieces. Explanation of  the different coordinate systems (sinusoidal pixel/line and  spherical lat/lon).</li><li>Maybe the behavior of the satllite? How it spun around the planet,  how it recorded radar data. A diagram of the orbit inclincation  angle could help, and the rotation direction of Venus. I drew one of  those already. This could extend into a discussion on doppler/range  because that may be important to the work anyway. (WIP)</li><li>Validation<ul><li>Producing pictures from other research papers</li><li>Studying the data to see if it corresponds with how we think the satellite would&rsquo;ve moved around Venus.</li><li>libvaxdata&rsquo;s VAX floating point test cases for VAX conversion.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></body>
