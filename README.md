# Status Report:

We can read in the binary data from a single orbit from the Magellan
Mission and view it as greyscale images.

We're currently researching leads on what to do next. There are
existing tools for generating DEMs, but would not be directly
compatible with the Magellan data. There's also existing work on the
Magellan data we could improve on. Finally, there are tools to create
DEMs used for later planetary missions; perhaps we could make use of
those by making them compatible with magellan data.
